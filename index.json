Likewise, these positions need are not static but rather frequently change in response to external events or shifts in public sentiment. Understanding when/how such changes in party positioning occur and how they relate to voter support can provide campaign managers with valuable insights for their positioning or branding strategies. Despite this relevance, marketing research has mainly developed approaches for studying brand positioning and given little attention to political parties. To fill this gap, we introduce an approach for estimating high-frequency time series of party positions from textual data. Our approach leverages recent innovations from natural language processing and market structure analysis (transformer models and dynamic mapping). We apply our approach to thousands of parliamentary speeches in Germany over 24 years and use these estimates to quantify party positioning along various dimensions, such as their temporal consistency or degree of differentiation. Our text-based estimates uncover multiple significant shifts in Germany’s political landscape, such as the con-/divergence of competing parties. We show that these shifts in party positioning can substantially help to predict shifts in voter support, measured via weekly election polls, above and beyond established indicators.

In response, many firms provide such information to attract consumers during their online searches. Thereby, a prerequisite for successfully attracting a firm’s target audience is identifying what information these consumers desire. To do so, firms must understand consumers’ information needs, that is, the information consumers seek to obtain with their searches. Yet, identifying information needs is non-trivial, as information needs naturally are (I) unobservable and (II) heterogeneous across consumers. This article aims to provide an approach for identifying consumers’ information needs within their online searches. To do so, we develop a novel market research approach and validate it in an empirical application. Our approach enables researchers and firms to collect primary data at scale in a real-time online search environment, and identify consumer information needs through unstructured data analysis. We implement our approach for online searches around “credit cards” in Germany. Our approach reveals nine broad information needs, including information around prices and fees, specific brands, traveling, or mobile payment options.

This article provides a new approach to identifying consumers’ information needs. Our approach tracks consumers’ search behavior via a custom-developed search simulator and uses textual data analysis to infer consumers’ information needs from the recorded search queries. We apply our approach to identify consumers’ information needs when searching for a new credit card.

Thereby, their speeches can reveal their underlying positioning – potentially in very high frequency. Herein, we propose a method for estimating high-frequency time-series of party positioning from their members’ parliamentary speeches. Our approach leverages two recent methodological innovations: pre-trained language models and dynamic scaling. We apply our approach to data covering parliamentary speeches within the German Bundestag during a 12-year period. Our monthly positioning estimates are highly consistent with a plethora of established benchmarks derived from manifesto texts, expert-surveys, roll-cast votes, or party-embeddings. In contrast to extant approaches, our estimates uncover substantial positioning dynamics across and within legislative periods. We demonstrate that simple measures of positioning dynamics can help to explain up to 20%p of additional variance in weekly election polls.

In Marketing, such maps are typically used to analyze the competitive positions within a market (so-called market structure analysis). There, data can originate from surveys, clickstreams, text-mining, embeddings, or many others. Beyond Marketing, such maps can be used to study different kinds of networks (e.g., social, economic, or financial networks), political ideology, or act as a general tool for dimensionality reduction. In many cases, such data is nowadays available longitudinally, i.e., for multiple subsequent points in time. `evomap` allows users to preprocess such data efficiently, implements muliple (static and dynamic) mapping methods from Psychometrics and Computer Science, and provides users with an easy-to-use API to explore the results. On the technical side, `evomap` is an independent Python package, easily compatible with other data science pipelines (such as `scikit-learn`), and implements runtime optimization via C.\n`evomap` is based on my dissertational research on dynamic mapping, and currently supports ongoing research projects, industry applications, and teaching in marketing analytics.\nA first pre-release version is available via GitHub (soon on PyPi!).
