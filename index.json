What do LLMs truly ‚Äúknow‚Äù about marketing, and how effectively can they reason with and apply that knowledge? To answer these questions, we compile a dataset of approximately 33,000 questions from 25 marketing textbooks spanning 12 subfields and evaluate LLMs‚Äô ability to answer them. Current LLMs show strong overall performance, answering 83%‚Äì87% of questions correctly. To understand the drivers of their performance, we leverage variation in answer accuracy within textbooks and assess three dimensions: (i) domain knowledge, (ii) reasoning ability, and (iii) AI-human interaction. We find consistently strong performance across subfields, including niche areas. LLMs‚Äô reasoning abilities are strong, with near-perfect recall and understanding of concepts, but decline slightly on tasks requiring higher-order (‚Äì9%) and numerical reasoning (‚Äì13%) or involving false statement detection (‚Äì20%). In turn, accuracy is largely unaffected by prompt- or question-wording. Additional experiments manipulating question phrasing indicate that the high performance does not result from matching surface patterns in our specific question set.

Thereby, their speeches can reveal their underlying positioning ‚Äì potentially in very high frequency. Herein, we propose a method for estimating high-frequency time-series of party positioning from their members‚Äô parliamentary speeches. Our approach leverages two recent methodological innovations: pre-trained language models and dynamic scaling. We apply our approach to data covering parliamentary speeches within the German Bundestag during a 12-year period. Our monthly positioning estimates are highly consistent with a plethora of established benchmarks derived from manifesto texts, expert-surveys, roll-cast votes, or party-embeddings. In contrast to extant approaches, our estimates uncover substantial positioning dynamics across and within legislative periods. We demonstrate that simple measures of positioning dynamics can help to explain up to 20%p of additional variance in weekly election polls.

In Marketing, such maps are typically used to analyze the competitive positions within a market (so-called market structure analysis). There, data can originate from surveys, clickstreams, text-mining, embeddings, or many others. Beyond Marketing, such maps can be used to study different kinds of networks (e.g., social, economic, or financial networks), political ideology, or act as a general tool for dimensionality reduction. In many cases, such data is nowadays available longitudinally, i.e., for multiple subsequent points in time. `evomap` allows users to preprocess such data efficiently, implements muliple (static and dynamic) mapping methods from Psychometrics and Computer Science, and provides users with an easy-to-use API to explore the results. On the technical side, `evomap` is an independent Python package, easily compatible with other data science pipelines (such as `scikit-learn`), and implements runtime optimization via C.\n`evomap` is based on my dissertational research on dynamic mapping, and currently supports ongoing research projects, industry applications, and teaching in marketing analytics.\n  function toggleShowMore(link) { var abstract = link.parentElement.nextElementSibling; if (abstract.style.display === 'none' || abstract.style.display === '') { abstract.style.display = 'block'; link.innerHTML = '[show less]'; } else { abstract.style.display = 'none'; link.innerHTML = '[show more]'; } }  ","tags":null,"title":"evomap","type":"software"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"ce5f66247e7096d3c36db1f3935de701","permalink":"/presentation/2021_cologne/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2021_cologne/","section":"presentation","summary":"Joint Research Seminar with U.
