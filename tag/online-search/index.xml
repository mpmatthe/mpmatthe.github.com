&lt;p>Effective online advertising depends on a marketer’s ability to reach a target audience—a specific group of consumers with desired characteristics. Traditionally, marketers have identified these consumers by tracking and analyzing their online behavior. However, growing privacy concerns and new regulations are restricting this practice. In response, this research investigates an alternative strategy for reaching target audiences online: inferring consumer characteristics solely from search queries consumers use when searching online. We empirically test the premise that search queries contain valuable signals about consumer characteristics that allow marketers to identify those queries most indicative of their target audience. Across three contexts—weight loss, online dating, and personal investing—we demonstrate that search queries strongly indicate consumer characteristics such as socio-demographics, category experience, or brand preferences. A subsequent field study further supports the external validity and practical implications of these findings. Using our results, a leading retail bank launched a search advertising campaign targeting a particular high-value audience. This audience-specific campaign converted a higher share of new customers (+21.37%) who generated substantially more revenue (average trading volume per customer: +97.90%), compared to a performance-driven campaign designed by SEA experts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generative AI and the Commoditization of Marketing Knowledge</title><link>/workingpaper/03-llm-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/workingpaper/03-llm-knowledge/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
