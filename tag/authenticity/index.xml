&lt;p>Many brands leverage authenticity to connect with consumers by embodying values that resonate with them, fostering a sense of shared purpose. Yet, despite its advantages, such a values-based positioning might entail substantial risks for demand. We argue that when consumer-brand relationships are premised on a brand&amp;rsquo;s consistent commitment to its values, demand-side authenticity beliefs carry a binding liability. If a brand action disrupts these beliefs, it may cause non-compensatory consumer reactance. To document a possible impact of such an authenticity violation on consumer demand, we leverage a recent brand acquisition in a mainstream consumer goods category (spices). Using difference-indifference and synthetic control methods, we estimate that the acquisition-widely perceived as an authenticity violation-led to a 22.74% decline in brick-and-mortar sales and a 32.02% demand decline online. Content analysis of social media records confirms that this decline was indeed driven by a loss of consumers' beliefs in brand authenticity. We further suggest that the violation&amp;rsquo;s impact was transmitted through the brand&amp;rsquo;s reliance on influencers: many influencers publicly withdrew their support following the acquisition. Our findings demonstrate how authenticity, while a valuable marketing asset, can also expose brands to severe demand risks when violated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
